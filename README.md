## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer. I primarily code in Python, but sometimes I also touch other programming languages.

- ðŸ¤“ I enjoy Mathematics and Science.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Mallard](https://github.com/DuongNam1/Mallard), a chess engine based on Python. I'm looking for help with the project.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open-source project that could fit in my range of skills.
